* Installation

** Nix

This repo is a nix flake.  You can just add ~overlays.default~ output to your
nixpkgs overlays.

#+begin_src nix
{
  inputs.pueue.url = "github:xFA25E/pueue";
  outputs = { self, pueue, nixpkgs }: let
    pkgs = import nixpkgs {
      system = "your-system";
      overlays = [ pueue.overlays.default ];
    };
  in {
    # YOUR OUTPUTS
  };
}
#+end_src

** Package manager

If you've installed it with your package manager, you're done.  ~pueue~ command
is autoloaded, so you can call it right away.

** Manual

It depends on the following packages:

+ with-editor

Then put /pueue.el/ file in your ~load-path~, and put the following in your init
file:

#+begin_src elisp
(require 'pueue)
#+end_src

* Usage

Run ~pueue~ command.  You can press ~?~ key or call ~describe-mode~ to discover
available keybindings.  Dired-like marking also works.

** Tips

+ You can customize settings in the *pueue* group.

+ Required version of pueue is 2.0.0.  Although the visualization of tasks and
  detailed view will work with 1.0.0, some commands (like group) have changed
  their API since 2.0.0.
